25)why is assert used in node js?
The Node.js Assert is a way to write tests. It provides no feedback when running your test unless one fails. The assert module provides a simple set of assertion tests that can be used to test invariants. The module is intended for internal use by Node.js, but can be used in application code via require ('assert').

var assert = require('assert');    
function add (a, b) {    
  return a + b;    
}    
var expected = add(1,2);    
assert( expected === 3, 'one plus two is three');
